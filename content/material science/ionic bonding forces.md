When two [[ionic bonding|ions]] are brought closer to each other, both of them exert forces on each other.

- $F_A$ - an attractive force
	- caused by the type of bonding between the two atoms
- $F_R$ - a repelling force
	- caused by the negatively charged electron clouds coming close to each other
	- only becomes significant when the two atoms get very close

- remember that $E=\int F \cdot dx$
	- so in this graph, $F = \frac{d}{dr}E$

- at $r_o$, $F_A + F_R = 0$, and the system is at a state of equilibrium
	- this is also the point of the lowest potential energy
	- approximated 0.3 nm

- $E_0$ is the *bonding energy*
