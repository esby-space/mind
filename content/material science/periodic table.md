- elements in the same column have similar [[valence electrons]] structures
	- creates similar physical and chemical properties

- the noble gasses
	- living in group 0, their [[valence electrons]] shell are totally full!
	- this is a very *stable electron configuration*
	- inert, don't make chemical reactions with other elements very easily
- the halogens
	- living in group VIIA, they only need one electron to be more stable
	- very [[electronegativity|electronegative]]
- the alkaline earth metals
	- living in group 1A, they only have 1 valence electron
- 
	- very [[electronegativity|electropositive]]
	-

- the transition metals
	- partially filled *d* electron states
