1. **Metals**
	- Iron, Tin, Aluminum, Alloys, Steel
	- Dense, strong, resistant to fracture, conductors, non transparent
	- Structural, aerospace, electronics

2. **Ceramics**
	- SiO2, BN
	- Stiff, brittle, hard, fracture easily, insulating, resistant to high temperatures and hard environments
	- High temperature load bearing, corrosion-resistant

3. **Polymers**
	- Low density, low stiffness and strength, pliable, chemically inert, low electrical conductivity, melt at low temperatures
	- Plastics, adhesives

4. **Composites**
	- mixture of multiple types of materials
	- CFRC - carbon fiber reinforced concrete
	- can improve stiffness, lower density
