Ionic bonding occurs between two elements of very different [[electronegativity]] values (large $\Delta\chi$, often on two ends of the [[periodic table]]). This causes an electron transfer between the two atoms, turning the giving atom into a positive ion and the receiving atom into a a negative ion.

Take NaCl, or table salt.
$NaCl=Na^+Cl^-$

Since Sodium only has 1 [[valence electrons|electron]] in its outer shell, and Chlorine is 1 electron missing from having a complete outer shell, Sodium is happy to give the electron and Chlorine is happy to receive it. The [[ionic bonding forces]] between the two can also be determined.

Not all bonds between atoms are ionic or [[covalent bonding|covalent bonds]]. Sometimes they exhibit properties of both. For this, we can determine a bond's [[ionic characteristic]].
