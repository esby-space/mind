In the [[quantum model]] of the atom, **quantum numbers** serve as an "address" for every electron to figure out which orbital it's in. They are necessary to describe the [[electron configuration]] of an atom.

1. $n$ -> the principle quantum number: shell of the orbital
	- roughly the average distance of the electron orbital
	- similar to the [[bohr model]]

2. $l$ -> the azimuthal quantum number: sub-shell of the orbital
	- $0<=l<=n-1$

| $l$ | letter |
| --- | ------ |
| 0   | s      |
| 1   | p      |
| 2   | d      |
| 3   | f      |

3. $m_l$ -> the magnetic quantum number: orbital number
	- $-l <= m_1 <= l$
	- all orbitals in a sub-shell have the same energy
		- (unless under a magnetic field)

4. $m_i$ -> the spin quantum number: spin of the electron
	- can either be $1/2$ or $-1/2$
	- every orbital can hold a max of 2 electrons
		- electrons must have a different spin
