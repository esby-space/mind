Chemical bonds are elements turn into molecules! Understanding the chemical bonds in a material is incredible important in understanding its [[material properties|properties]].

## primary bonds

primary bonds are very strong, and often involve the exchange or sharing of [[valence electrons]]. This often means primary bonds happen within a molecule (intramolecular)

1. [[ionic bonding]]
2. [[covalent bonding]]
3. [[metallic bonding]]

## secondary bonds

secondary bonds are not as strong as primary bonds, but still can have a major affect on [[material properties]]. Unlike primary bonds, secondary bonds only happen between molecules (intermolecular).

1. [[Dipole-dipole interactions]]
2. [[Hydrogen Bonding]]
3. [[Dipole-induced-dipole interactions]]
4. [[Fluctuating dipoles]]
