Instead of transferring an electron from one atom to another like in [[ionic bonding]], atoms in a covalent bonds share some electrons. This happens between two elements with a low difference in [[electronegativity]] (low $\Delta\chi$).

In an atom not bounded in a molecule, not all [[valence electrons]] are created equal. So to facilitate bonding, atoms often go through [[orbit hybridization]] so they can form molecules and reach a lower energy state. Because of this, covalent bonds are directional unlike [[ionic bonding|ionic bonds]].

Not all bonds between atoms are ionic or [[covalent bonding|covalent bonds]]. Sometimes they exhibit properties of both. For this, we can determine a bond's [[ionic characteristic]].
