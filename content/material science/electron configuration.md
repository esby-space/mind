Electron configuration describes where all my electrons are! For that, we need to know the [[quantum numbers]] of the electrons.

Describing the *ground state* (the state with the lowest energy) of an atom relies on three principles:

1. The Pauli Exclusion Principle ^af37e8
	- no two electrons of one atom can have the same quantum numbers

2. **Aufbau Principle**
	- for the ground state, we want to fill in electrons from the lowest energy level to the highest

	 - 1s -> 2s -> 2p -> 3s -> 3p -> 4s -> 3d -> etc.

3. Hund's Principle
	- every orbital in a sub-shell should be singularly occupied before doubling up
	- all singularly occupied orbitals should have the same spin
