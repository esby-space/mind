Electronegativity ($\chi$) describes an atoms willingness to take up an electron and unwillingness to give it up.
- electropositive -> capable of giving up their valence electrons and becoming positive ions
- electronegative -> capable of receiving valence electrons and becoming negative ions

- in the [[periodic table]], electronegativity increases moving left to right and from bottom to top
	- left to right -> more likely to accept an electron if the outer shell is almost full of [[valence electrons]]
	- bottom to top -> more likely to accept an electron if they're closer to the nucleus

- in a bond, the atom with a larger electron affinity will have a higher electron density around its nucleus
