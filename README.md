welcome to my brain!

i use this weird thing called [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to try to understand complex topics. i use it for studying, taking notes, writing essays, creating projects, etc. and it's all right here! i haven't been using it for very long, so it's not too big, but maybe that'll change one day.

tech used:
- [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
